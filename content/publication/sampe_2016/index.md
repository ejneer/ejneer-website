abstract:
  Nanotube reinforcement has the potential to provide significant mechanical improvement of polymer matrices. 
  For three-phase composites (matrix/nanofiber/microfiber), this affords the opportunity to enhance off-axis properties dominated by the matrix. 
  Before carbon nanotubes can be effectively used as a composite reinforcement, there must be a method of predicting stiffness gained from their use. 
  Researchers have attempted to adapt micromechanical analyses (typically reserved for microfiber composites) to the nanoscale. 
  One such model from Anumandla and Gibson (2006) accounts for nanotube orientation and waviness (ratio of amplitude to wavelength of assumed sinusoid) and relied upon the Chamis micromechanics equations. 
  This is improved by implementing the Halpin-Tsai model, known for its accuracy at low reinforcement loadings, where nano-composites are typically fabricated. 
  Extension to three-phase composites is done using laminated plate theory.  
  
  Micromechanical approaches are shown to be appropriate for use on the nano-scale (with proper considerations, identified in this work). Published experimental data for two-phase nano-composites is compared to the current model.   Nanotube waviness is seen as a key parameter in composite stiffness. Modulus results agree well for waviness values within 10% and qualitatively agree with nano-composite SEM/TEM images. Three-phase data is limited, but initial   comparisons show improvements in off-axis properties within a few percent.
