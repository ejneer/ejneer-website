abstract: Carbon nanotubes are a relatively new area of research which has gained significant attention in published literature.
  One reason for this interest is their usein multi-phase composites, specifically where they can enhance traditional polymer matrices.
  Many authors have attempted to adapt conventional micromechanical analyses reserved for microfibers to the nano scale.
  A review of these works is presented. 
  In depth analysis is provided on one of these two phase (nanotube andmatrix) models, the Anumandla-Gibson model, originally published in 2006.
  A discussion of its strengths and sensitivities is given, with numerical data to support the conclusions.
  It is extended to three-phase composites through the use of classical laminated plate theory.
  A literature survey is conducted to gather published two and three-phase experimental results for comparison.
  Two phase experimental results agree well with the present model, whereas three phase data was limited, but initial comparisons were promising.
