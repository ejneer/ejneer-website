<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting technique, wherein a larger problem is divided and the resulting sub-problem is solved.
The general mergesort strategy is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recursively divide the items to be sorted until no further division is possible.</li>
<li>Merge the two halves of the prior division, putting elements in order as the halves are merged.
This is the step where all of the heavy lifting is done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the graph above, the top half shows the division of the word “SORTING” until there are only individual letters left.
The letters (length-1 arrays) are subsequently merged <em>in order</em> into larger arrays.
Merging continues until the original inputs are realized, now in sorted order.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all division and merging are done in parallel, as the graph may suggest (at least for the <a href="#implementation">implementation</a> presented here).
In reality, elements on the left side of the graph will be divided and merged prior to those on the right.
This is depicted in the animation below, where left-most elements are put in order prior to those on their right.
The highlighted elements for each iteration show how the algorithm proceeds in a left-to-right fashion.</p>

<div id="complexity" class="section level3">
<h3>Complexity</h3>
<p>Recursive bisection of an array down to a single element has <span class="math inline">\(O(\ln(n))\)</span> complexity.
Each merging step iterates over a particular array once, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> complexity.
Thus, the mergesort algorithm has a complexity of <span class="math inline">\(O(n\lg(n))\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation" class="section level3">
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>The python mergesort implementation shown here favors readability and understandability over any performance concerns.
There are several list-copying operations that could be avoided by passing around a single list and keeping track of element indices.
I feel this obscures relevant algorithmic details, and present things in a form easiest for me to understand.</p>
<p>Two opposing helper functions are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bisect</code> splits a given array, returning a tuple of the two halves.</li>
<li><code>merge</code> takes two already sorted arrays and merges them in order to a single array.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="python"><code>def bisect(array):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Split an array down the middle, return both halves.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; bisect([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
    ([5, 4], [3, 2, 1])

    &gt;&gt;&gt; bisect([13, 42])
    ([13], [42])
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    middle = len(array) // 2
    return array[0:middle], array[middle : len(array)]</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>def merge(left, right):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; merge([1, 7, 13], [0, 3, 4, 10])
    [0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13]
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    merged = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] &lt; right[0]:
            merged.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            merged.append(right.pop(0))

    while left:
        merged.append(left.pop(0))
    while right:
        merged.append(right.pop(0))

    return merged</code></pre>
<p><code>merge_sort</code> coordinates the helper functions and is responsible for recursive division and merging.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def merge_sort(array):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Sort an array using the mergesort algorithm.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; merge_sort([13, 42, 8, 0, 2, -56])
    [-56, 0, 2, 8, 13, 42]

    &gt;&gt;&gt; merge_sort([&#39;s&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;g&#39;])
    [&#39;g&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;t&#39;]
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    if len(array) &gt; 1:
        left, right = bisect(array)
        left = merge_sort(left)
        right = merge_sort(right)
        return merge(left, right)
    return array</code></pre>
</div>
